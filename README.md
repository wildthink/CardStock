# SwiftUI Card Models and Supporting Views

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildthink/CardStock/main/Assets/card_closed.png" width="500">

Cards are a classic design pattern, perfect for mobile devices.

They create personalized experiences by pulling together individual 
content pieces. Mobile tech and data access have pushed the web 
towards aggregated content instead of linked pages.

Cards shine on different screen sizes. On phones, stack them vertically
like an activity stream. On tablets, flip to stack horizontally. Use 
fixed or variable heights to fit your design.

Make your app dynamic and responsive with SwiftUI card models and 
supporting views.
